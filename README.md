#Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome lecture slides and source material

Here you will find my source files for making my CNS lecture slides.  The source files are in pandoc's markdown and intended to be used with beamer to make slides.

##Scripts

makeslides - process the markdown source with pandoc to make a beamer pdf

makeslidetex - process the markdown source with pandoc but output the tex file rather than the pdf, useful for tweaking prior to making the slide set.
