NB: the pandoc documentation says you can close the speaker notes tag (above) with the trailing greater than sign but if you do that it seems to put it into the beamer slide show.  These speaker notes really only work in reveal.js slideshows anyway.  I am using this note style now to allow for an easier tranistion should I go to reveal.js in the future, will likely need to close those speaker note tags at that time.>

#Introduction

##Let's get started!

![](./img/IMG_1842.JPG)

##What kind of patients are we talking about anyway?

Nephrotic Syndrome

:    Children over the age of 1 year
    
	  Edema
    
	  Urine Protein:Creatinine ratio (uPCR) >= 2000mg/g
    
	  Urine Protein > 300mg/dL
    
	  Dipstick Urine protein 3+
    
	  Hypoalbuminemia (<= 2.5mg/L)

What is missing from the case definition?

<div class="notes" 
* We restrict to children less than 1 year old since under that age you are likely dealing with congenital nephrotic syndrome, a different animal.
* In the past the case definition included a total amount of protein to be excreted over 24 hours (less than 3.5gm).  
* Current approach calls for the use of a protein:creatinine ratio instead of a 24 hour urine, more accurate, easier to do and cheaper.  
* It is helpful to know old practices because in the developing world you may find they are still using the old ways.>
</div>

##Important resources to know

* ISKDC - International Study of Kidney Disease in Children 
* KDIGO - Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (www.kdigo.org/home/glomerulonephritis-gn)

<div class="notes"
* ISKDC - - conducted from 1967-1974 in North America, Europe and Asia, followed hundreds of kids for years, collected data on diagnostic markers, biopsy results, treatment outcomes, etc.
* KDIGO came out in 2012, collates evidence for treatment of various conditions.  Chapters 3 and 4 deal with childhood nephrotic syndrome.  Evidence for various interventions is GRADEd (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Education). Get a copy at >
</div>

##Obligatory Epidemiology Slide

* 1-3 (some reports as high as 7)/100,000 children under the age of 16
* Black and Hispanic kids in the US more likely to have steroid resistant disease
* Male to Female - from 2:1 to 3:2 in young children, equal in older kids (>8yo)
* Lower incidence of steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome in African children
* Increased incidence (all types) in Asians (up to 6 times increase in some studies)

<div class="notes" 
I got interested in nephrology because of all the NS I was seeing in China ... and nephrologists have cool toys and get to work with numbers a lot.  For whatever reason Asian kids have more NS, more HSP, more membranous nephropathy, etc. >

#Steroid Sensitive Nephrotic Syndrome


##Xiao Ma - The case

Xiao Ma is a 3YO Asian male who presented to his local doc 3 days ago with puffy eyes.  The local doc gave cholorpheniramine and sent him home.  He comes back today with extension of the swelling to the feet and legs.

##Xiao Ma - The discussion

* Most likely what time of day did he present initially?
* What tests do you want to do?
* What therapy should you start?
* What is the most important predictor of outcome in Xiao Ma's case?

<div class="notes"
Time - He probably came in the morning the first time and the afternoon the second - the edema is gravity dependent and so will be around the eyes when you wake up and at the legs when you have been playing all day.

Tests - urinalysis, protein:creatinine ratio, CBC, renal function/electrolytes, serum albumin.

Therapy - steroids, discuss lasix and albumin, discuss antibiotics

Predictor - steroid responsiveness trumps pathology >
</div>

##Initial approach to therapy for Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome

* Steroids are the mainstay
* Initial dose is 2mg/kg/day or 60mg/m2/day in single daily dose
* Don't reduce the dose for at least 4 weeks, better to go for 6 weeks
* Follow up dose of 1.5mg/kg alternate days and tapered over 2 - 5 months

<div class="notes"
Why 2mg/kg/day?  ISKDC used it and no one has looked at that since
Why 4-6 weeks?  Moderate quality evidence that this decreases relapses with an improvement of diminished relapses with up to 6 months of therapy 
What do I do?  Give as above, 6 weeks of induction, 6 weeks of q other day for consolidation (with taper)>
</div>

##Why so long?

Hodson, et.al. did some meta-analysis of RCTs using steroid therapy regimens.

Objective           Result                         Stats stuff
---------           ------                         -----------
3 vs. 2 months      30% relapse reduction          RR 0.7 (0.58-.84)
6 vs. 3 months      reduction in 12-24m relapse    RR 0.57 (0.45-0.71)

<div class="notes" 
The initial meta-analysis showed an inverse linear relationship of relapse risk between 2 and three months.  Looks like the longer the better. Probably a big benefit of tapering the drugs is the help to prolong the therapy and thus reduce relapse risk.>
</div>

##Relapse Therapy - The Return of Xiao Ma

Poor Xiao Ma got a cold. It has been 5 months since his original episode but now he has three plus protein in his urine by mom's home albustix.  She calls the office for advice.

* What are you going to tell her?

<div class="notes" 
Typical relapse scenario - get a intercurrent infection, get a relapse, even if you you treated long enough the first time.  Xiao Ma is going to need steroids again.>
</div>

##Approach to Relapse Therapy in Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome

Relapse

:   uPCR >= 2000mg/g (200mg/mmol)
    
	 3+ protein on dipstick for 3 consecutive days

Infrequent Relapse

:   One relapse within 6 months of initial response

    1-3 relapses in a 12 month period

* 80-90% of children will have a relapse, half of those will have an infrequently relapsing course
* Prednisone dose is the same initially, treat until protein free for 3 days (trace or less)
* After initial therapy give 1.5mg/kg every other day for 4 weeks minimum

<div class="notes"
About 80% of kids with NS relapse, no matter their pathology or steroid sensitivity.
Be sure to teach moms to cut albustix in half or thirds length wise to save money.
* Relapses can be monitored and treated at home
* The mainstay of relapse therapy is ... steroids
* No RCTs looking at relapse regimens

#Frequent Relapse/Steroid Dependent Therapy

##Xiao Li

Xiao Li has nephrotic syndrome and has had multiple relapses.  Every time he responds to the steroids but then relapses whenever he is ill.  "It just seems he is addicted to the steroids!"

* What do you suppose is his mother's number one concern?
* Do you need to do any more workup? If so what tests do you want to run?
* What therapy can you offer this family?

<div class="notes"
Mom is almost certainly concerned about the side effects of the steroids.  By now he is becoming cushingoid, may have stria, may not be sleeping and is likely eating her out of house and home.  He really looks different from other kids which is causing mom much stress.>
</div>

##Definitions

Frequent Relapse

:    2+ relapses within 6 months of initial response

     4+ relapses within a 12 month period

Steroid dependence

:    2 consecutive relapses during corticosteroid therapy or within 14 days of ceasing therapy

##Steroid side effects

![Cushing Syndrome](/home/tom/Documents/lectures/2013Louisville/img/cushing-syndrome-big.jpg)

##Steroid side effects

* Obesity
* Hypertension
* Impaired linear growth
* Cushing syndrome
* Cataracts, etc.
* Impaired glucose tolerance
* Reduced bone mineral density
* Etc. (skin changes, behavior changes ...)

##Who is most likely to become a frequent relapser?

* Short time to first relapse
* Number of relapses in first six months
* Younger age
* Male gender
* Prolonged time to first remission
* Infection with first relapse
* Hematuria at presentation

##Approach to therapy - Steroids

* Daily prednisone until remission for 3 days
* Alternate day prednisone for 3 months minimum
* Daily prednisone at lowest dose possible for SD patients
* Consider daily prednisone during times of URI or other infection in kids with FR or SD disease who are already on alternate day therapy

##Approach to therapy - Steroid sparing agents

Corticosteroid sparing agents

1. Alkylating Agents (cyclosporing/chlorambucil)
1. Calcinurin inhibitors (cyclosporine/tacrolimus)
1. Mycophenolate mofetil
1. Rituximab

##Alkylating Agents

Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan)

* 2mg/kg/day for 8-12 weeks
* check weekly CBCs
* only given after remission achieved

Chlorambucil

* 0.1-0.2mg/kg/day for 8 weeks

Others: Levamisole, Mizoribine, Azothioprine

<div class="notes" 
* max dose of Cytoxan is 168mg/kg
* most experts recommend against a second round
* Chlorambucil has higher risk of malignancy and narrow therapeutic window
* Levamisole can be used at 2.5mg/kg/d for 12 months, kids tend to relapse when stopping levamisole
* Mizoribine and Azothiaprine are not recommended in any circumstance
>
</div>

##Calcineurin inhibitors

Cyclosporine

* 4-5mg/kg/d divided bid
* Keep 12 hour troughs 80-150ng/mL (67-125nmol/l)

Tacrolimus

* 0.1mg/kg/d divided bid
* Monitor troughs (5-10ng/mL, 6-12nmol/l)

##Calcineurin inhibitors

Cyclosporine side effects

Side Effect                    Prevalance
------------                   --------------
Hypertension                   5-10%
Renal dysfunction              5-10%
Tubulointerstitial lesions     30-40% of patients after 12 months
Hypertrichosis                 70%
Gum hypertrophy                30%


<div class="notes"
Cyclosporine side effects - renal dysfunction, hypertension, gum hypertrophy, hypertrichosis
Tacrolimus side effects - renal dysfunction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus
Also consider cost, geography (tacrolimus very popular in North America)
some data suggests Ketoconazole increases cyclosporine levels with no reduction in efficacy, no RCTs to prove that though
>
</div>

##Using CNIs

Caveats

* Both cause renal dysfunction
* Frequently see relapse when stopping therapy (become "CNI" dependent)
* Cost

##Lesser established therapies

Mycophenolate mofetil

* 1200mg/m2/d divided bid
* give for at least 12 months (longer OK)
* some abdominal pain and diarrhea, can cut dose in half
* no levels needed

<div class="notes"
Studies have shown can go up to 45 months 
May atenuate the dose of CNIs (cyclosporine) if used in conjunction
>
</div>
##Lesser established therapies

Mycophenolate mofetil

Hogg, et. al. study

* Prospective study design
* Enrollment - 33 kids (26 with FR SSNS)
* Gave MMF for 6 months
* 24 kids stayed in remission (75%)
* 12 kids relapse free for 6 months post-treatment
* 8 of the 12 relapse free for up to 30 months follow up

##Lesser established therapies

Coming attractions: Clinicaltrials.gov

![](./img/clinicaltrials_gov2.jpg)

* Compare efficacy of MMF vs. cyclophosphamide therapies
* Looking forward to results in September, 2014

##Lesser established therapies

Rituximab

* Anti-CD20 monoclonal
* 375mg/m2/dose, up to four weekly doses
* Some studies with great results (anecdotal data of 80% remission rate)
* Ravani, et.al. showed significant reduction in relapse rate at 3 months a small, open label RCT

##Lesser established therapies

Coming attractions: Clinicaltrials.gov

![](./img/clinicaltrials_gov_rituximab1.jpg)

* Look at use of rituximab in the CNI "dependent" patients

##Renal Biopsy

Renal biopsy can be helpful in evaluating prognosis, do a biopsy for

* late failure to respond to steroids following initial response
* high index of suspicion of different underlying pathology
* decreasing renal function in child on CNI therapy

<div class="notes"
"Late failure" means they responded the first time and maybe even on intial relapses but afterwards stop responding.
Consider epidemiology - African and African-American populations are more likely to have FSGS, Northern European and Indian populations are more likely to have MCD.
Punchline - routine biopsy is not indicated
